# Mars_Exploration_Rover_Simulation
Explore Mars virtually with our Simulation Project! Command rovers on missions, guided by a central base station.
<h1>Introduction:</h1>
The project aims to simulate the assignment of exploratory missions to different regions of Mars,
facilitated by a hypothetical base station and various types of rovers.
Through programming skills and knowledge of data structures, 
the program will simulate mission assignments and calculate related statistics to enhance the overall mission process.

<h1>Missions and Rovers:</h1>
For missions, information includes the Formulation Day, Mission Type (Emergency, Mountainous, Polar),
Target Location distance from the base station, Mission Duration, and Significance.
Rovers are categorized as Emergency, Mountainous, or Polar, with details such as Checkup Duration, and Speed.

<h1>Missions Assignment Criteria:</h1>
Priority is given to Emergency missions, followed by Polar and Mountainous missions. 
Specific assignment criteria are outlined based on rover availability and mission type.

<h1>Additional Services:</h1>
For Mountainous missions, requests for mission promotion to Emergency status or cancellation can be issued.
Additionally, if a Mountainous mission waits beyond a certain threshold, it can be automatically promoted to Emergency status.

<h1>Data Structures and Algorithms:</h1>
The simulation employs incremental day steps to simulate system changes. 
Definitions such as Formulation Day, Waiting Mission, In-Execution Mission, Completed Mission, Waiting Days, Execution Days,
and Completion Day are established to manage mission execution.
Assumptions are made regarding rover availability, mission formulation, assignment, and execution processes.
